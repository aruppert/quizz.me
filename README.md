## Installation

Just run:

```
 npm install

The script should automatically install the client. If something goes wrong:

cd client
npm install
```

## How to start

Open two terminals.
In one run:

```
npm run server
```

and in the other:

```
npm run client
```

The app should start in your browers (usually on http://localhost:3000)

## How to use?

To try out the full functionality please use the following URL, where this app has been deployed:

Otherwise you need to deploy your own server (e.g. a JSON Server.)

The datastructe of the two collections should look like this:

{
"\_id" : ObjectId("5e206675e63bec3db479c2cb"),
"question" : "What is considered the rarist form of color blindness?",
"correctAnswer" : "Blue",
"incorrectAnswer1" : "Red",
"incorrectAnswer2" : "Green",
"incorrectAnswer3" : "Purple",
"privateCode" : "",
"status" : "active"
}
